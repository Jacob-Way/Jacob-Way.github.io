<h1>One can hear the shape of ellipses of small eccentricity By Hamid Hezari and Steve Zelditch</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  This paper discusses the problem of hearing the shape of a drum. An intuitive version of the question is:
  drum heads of different sizes and shapes make a different noise when you hit them, but when do two differently shaped drums make the same noise?
  In this case, the authors are studying elliptical drums which are nearly circular, and show that each elliptical drum has a unique sound.
</p>
<p>
  Drums make a sound when hit due to the vibration of their head. The reason that a drum tends to make the same sound every time it is hit is that...

</p>
<p>
  We can use the function $u:\mathbb R^2\to \mathbb R$ to represent the vertical position of a string at each point,
  So $u(x,t)=0$ describes a flat string, and $u(x,t) = x$ represents a string that is sloping upwards and not moving, and $u(x,t) = t$ represents a string that is flat and moving upwards. <br>
  To model the string of an instrument, we can also assume that the ends of the string are not moving. <br>
  This results in the differential equation $\frac{d^2}{dx^2}u=c_1\frac{d}{dt}u=c_2u$, with the boundary conditions $u(0)=u(1)=0$. <br>
  The solutions are the functions $\sin()\sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})$, for all $n\in \mathbb N$, 
  $\Delta u$
</p>
***Does the equation always have a solution?
<h2>Weyl's Formula</h2>
<p>
  Weyl's formula allows us to calculate the area of a drum from the eigenvalues. $A = \omega_d^{-1}(2\pi)^d\lim_{R\to\infty}\frac{N(R)}{R^{d/2}}$, where $N(R) = \#\{n:\lambda_n\leq R\}$, $d$ is the dimension, and $\omega_d$ is the volume of the $d$-dimensional unit ball.
